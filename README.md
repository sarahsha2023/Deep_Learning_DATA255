Step 1. Follow along with the tutorial to gain an understanding of the process
Step 2. reproduce the results utilizing the "QMNIST" dataset
Step 3. Report on the results in terms of prediction accuracy on the train and test datasets 
Step 4. Choose one of the proposed modifications below:
Add another Dense layer of 128 nodes
Increase the current number of nodes in the layer to 256
Hypothesize how it would change the performance results
Step 5. Modify the model based on the chosen method and train
Step 6. Report on the results of the modified model and if it matches your hypothesis
Step 7. Experiment with different optimizers, loss functions, dropout, and activation functions, and observe the change in performance as you tune these hyperparameters.
Step 8. Show an example of a backpropagation algorithm by hand
